## Key Architectural Changes

### From: Flat Organization
```
packages/
├── ai/
├── react/
├── rsc/
├── openai/
├── anthropic/
├── google/
├── ... (50 packages mixed together)
```

### To: Domain-Driven Organization
```
packages/
├── core/              ← Foundation (ai, shared, telemetry)
├── providers/         ← 30+ LLM integrations
├── adapters/          ← Framework implementations
├── mcp/               ← Model Context Protocol
├── special/           ← Gateway, internal tools
├── validation/        ← Schema validation
└── infrastructure/    ← Testing utilities
```

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Domain-Driven Design
- Packages grouped by business capability
- Clear responsibility per domain
- Independent, understandable domains

### 2. Layered Architecture
```
Core Layer (foundation)
    ↓
Provider Layer (LLM integrations)
    ↓
Adapter Layer (frameworks)
    ↓
Tool Layer (utilities & infrastructure)
```

### 3. Explicit Boundaries
- **Public APIs**: Versioned, stable, backwards compatible
- **Internal APIs**: Subject to change, not for external use
- **Example APIs**: Reference only, copy & adapt

### 4. Clear Ownership
Every package has an assigned owner via CODEOWNERS.

### 5. Enterprise DX
- Automated setup (5 minutes)
- Clear contribution paths
- Governance & review requirements
- Generation tools for scaffolding

## What Gets Better

### For Developers

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 50 packages in flat list | Organized into 7 domains |
| Unclear what each package does | Clear ownership & purpose |
| Hard to find related code | Logical grouping by domain |
| Confusing import paths | Consistent naming convention |
| 2 hours to find where to contribute | 30 minutes with guides |

### For Maintainers

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| No clear ownership | CODEOWNERS covers everything |
| Hard to manage 50 packages | Organized layers with clear responsibilities |
| Scattered documentation | Centralized, hierarchical docs |
| Manual processes | Automated tooling & generators |
| No scaling strategy | Ready for 500+ contributors |

### For Operations

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Complex Turbo pipeline | Organized by layer with clear dependencies |
| Mixed concerns in CI/CD | Domain-specific workflows |
| Unclear test organization | Tests organized by layer |
| Manual release process | Automated via changesets |

## Decision Framework

### Domain Organization

**Why 7 domains?**
1. **Core**: Foundation dependencies (all packages need this)
2. **Providers**: LLM integrations (independent, parallel)
3. **Adapters**: Framework support (independent, parallel)
4. **MCP**: Special protocol (self-contained)
5. **Validation**: Schema libraries (supports everything)
6. **Special**: Gateway, internal tools (miscellaneous)
7. **Infrastructure**: Testing & utilities (supports dev)

### Naming Conventions

**Why `@ai-sdk/{domain}/{package}`?**
- Clear namespace
- Easy to find all providers/adapters
- Scales well with growth
- Familiar pattern from npm ecosystem

**Why CODEOWNERS for everything?**
- Automated review assignment
- Clear escalation paths
- Prevents unowned code
- Enforces governance

## FAQ

### Q: Why reorganize now?
A: Current flat structure doesn't scale beyond 50 packages. This prepares for 100+ packages and 500+ contributors.

### Q: Will this break my code?
A: We're keeping public APIs stable. Only internal structure changes. Migration guide provided.

### Q: How long will it take?
A: 20 weeks (5 months) for full migration. Phased approach minimizes disruption.

### Q: What about existing code?
A: Works as-is during migration. After v4.0 release, migration guide helps update imports.

### Q: Can I contribute during migration?
A: Yes! We maintain backwards compatibility and guide contributors to right locations.

### Q: Who should I talk to?
A: See CODEOWNERS for domain owners. Questions? Open a discussion.
