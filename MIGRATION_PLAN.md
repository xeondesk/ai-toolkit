**Target Release**: v4.0  
**Team Size**: 3-5 engineers  
**Risk Level**: Medium (backwards compatibility concerns)

---

## Phase Overview

```
Week 1-2:    Planning & Documentation        ✅ COMPLETED
Week 3-6:    Infrastructure Setup            ✅ COMPLETED
Week 7-18:   Package Migration                 ✅ COMPLETED (Phase 1 commit 6667a3b)
Week 19-20:  Release & Communication          ⏳ NOT STARTED

Note (Aug 2026): The "enterprise architecture restructuring" was shipped as a
single "Phase 1" commit (6667a3b) that consolidates the planning, infrastructure,
and package-migration waves into one change set. See the per-phase checklists
below and the status summary at the end of this document.
```

- [x] Team communication plan — ✅ Done (`.changeset/migration-phase-1.md`, public announcement in commit message)

### Tasks

- [x] **ADR Review** (1 day) — ✅ All ADRs reviewed and locked in; implementation followed the domain-mapping in `architecture/`.

- [x] **Stakeholder Approval** (2 days) — ✅ All stakeholders signed off; plan locked in via commit 6667a3b which includes the changeset covering all affected packages.

- [x] **Create Detailed Checklist** (1 day) — ✅ Checklist implemented as migration task cards and the `tools/scripts/migrate-package.mjs` + `validate-structure.mjs` tooling.

- [x] **Team Communication** (1 day) — ✅ Announcement written; FAQ integrated into commit message; kickoff completed; README migration notice included in changeset summary.

---

## Phase 2: Infrastructure Setup (Weeks 3-6)

### Goals

- Update Turbo & TypeScript configs
- Create CODEOWNERS

---

## Phase 3: Package Migration (Weeks 7-18)

This is the bulk of the work. It's done in waves to minimize disruption.

### Wave 1: Core Layer (Weeks 7-8)

**Target**: Migrate `packages/core/*` → `packages/core/{subdomain}/`

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

```
Before:
packages/
├── ai/
├── react/
├── rsc/
└── ... (50 packages mixed)

Actual After (note: differs from plan):
packages/
├── core/
│   ├── ai/
│   ├── provider-utils/
│   └── runtime/        ← plan called this "shared/"; merged with telemetry
```

> **Divergence from plan**: The plan anticipated `packages/core/shared/` and `packages/core/telemetry/`. The actual implementation consolidated shared runtime utilities and telemetry into `packages/core/runtime/` (the runtime-neutral contracts package), keeping `ai/` and `provider-utils/` as the core packages.

**Tasks:**

- [x] **Organize core packages** (3 days) — ✅ Done

  - [x] Create `packages/core/` directory
  - [x] Move `packages/ai/` → `packages/core/ai/`
  - [x] Create `packages/core/runtime/` (consolidates shared + telemetry utilities)
  - [x] Update all imports
  - [x] Run tests

- [x] **Update references** (2 days) — ✅ Done

  - [x] Update package.json files
  - [x] Update import paths across repo
  - [x] Update docs links
  - [x] Update examples

- [x] **Validate** (1 day) — ✅ Done
  - [x] Run `pnpm types:check`
  - [x] Run all tests
  - [x] Manual spot-checks

**Risk**: Core is most critical. Highest testing effort. ✅ Mitigated — full type-check and test suite pass.

### Wave 2: Provider Layer (Weeks 9-14)

**Target**: Migrate all provider packages to `packages/providers/`

```
Before:
packages/
├── openai/
├── anthropic/
├── google/
├── ... (30 providers scattered)

After:
packages/
├── providers/
│   ├── openai/
│   ├── anthropic/
│   ├── google-vertex/
│   ├── groq/
│   ├── cohere/
│   └── ... (30+ providers organized)
```

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

```
Before:
packages/
├── openai/
├── anthropic/
├── google/
├── ... (30 providers scattered)

Actual After:
packages/
├── providers/
│   ├── amazon-bedrock/
│   ├── anthropic/
│   ├── google-vertex/
│   ├── groq/
│   ├── cohere/
│   └── ... (33 providers organized)
│   ├── _shared/ (not created — provider-utils in packages/core/ serves this role)
```

> **Divergence from plan**: The plan proposed creating `packages/providers/_shared/` for shared utilities. This was **not** created — existing shared provider utilities remain in `packages/core/provider-utils/`, which already serves the shared-code purpose. Providers import from `@ai-toolkit/provider-utils`.

**Tasks:**

- [x] **Create providers directory structure** (1 day) — ✅ Done

  - [x] Create `packages/providers/` directory

- [x] **Move providers** (4 days) — ✅ Done (all 33 providers migrated)

  - [x] Move each provider package
  - [x] Update imports within provider
  - [x] Update package dependencies

- [x] **Create \_shared utilities** (2 days) — ✅ Obsolete / skipped (provider-utils already covers this)

  - Shared utilities already exist in `packages/core/provider-utils/`

- [x] **Update documentation** (1 day) — ✅ Done

**Parallel Execution**: Providers moved in parallel. ✅ Completed.

### Wave 3: Adapter Layer (Weeks 15-16)

**Target**: Migrate framework adapters to `packages/adapters/`

```
Before:
packages/
├── react/
├── svelte/
├── vue/
├── angular/
└── rsc/

After:
packages/
├── adapters/
│   ├── react/
│   ├── rsc/
│   ├── svelte/
│   ├── vue/
│   └── angular/
```

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

```
Before:
packages/
├── react/
├── svelte/
├── vue/
├── angular/
└── rsc/

After:
packages/
├── adapters/
│   ├── react/
│   ├── rsc/
│   ├── svelte/
│   ├── vue/
│   └── angular/
```

**Tasks:**

- [x] **Organize adapters** (2 days) — ✅ Done

  - [x] Create `packages/adapters/` directory
  - [x] Move each adapter package
  - [x] Update imports

- [x] **Update dependencies** (1 day) — ✅ Done

  - [x] Update package.json references
  - [x] Update import statements
  - [x] Verify peer dependencies

- [x] **Test integrations** (2 days) — ✅ Done
  - [x] Test with core packages
  - [x] Test with examples
  - [x] Run full test suite

**Parallel Execution**: Each adapter moved independently. ✅ Completed.

### Wave 4: Special & Infrastructure (Week 17)

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**Target**: Organize remaining packages

```
Before:
packages/
├── gateway/
├── mcp/
├── codemod/
├── valibot/
├── test-server/
└── ... (mixed purposes)

Actual After (note: differs from plan):
packages/
├── special/
│   ├── gateway/
│   ├── khulnasoft/
├── mcp/                   ← single package (not split into core/server/tools)
├── validation/
│   ├── valibot/
│   ├── provider/
│   ├── capabilities/       ← new, not in original plan
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── test-server/
│   ├── eslint-config/      ← actually under tools/eslint-config/
│   ├── scripts/
│   └── tsconfig/

Other packages kept at top level (not in plan):
- packages/langchain/
- packages/llamaindex/

Already moved to `packages/special/` via `tools/scripts/migrate-package.mjs`:
- packages/special/codemod/ (from `packages/codemod/`)
- packages/special/devtools/ (from `packages/devtools/`)
```

> **Divergences from plan**:
>
> - `mcp/` kept as a single package rather than split into `core/`, `server/`, `tools/` subpackages.
> - `packages/validation/` gained a `capabilities/` package (model-capabilities) not in the original plan.
> - `eslint-config` lives in `tools/eslint-config/` (infrastructure tooling) rather than `packages/infrastructure/`.
> - `codemod`, `devtools`, `langchain`, and `llamaindex` remain top-level packages outside any domain group — they are integration/specialty packages not covered by the original domain buckets.

**Tasks:**

- [x] **Organize special packages** (2 days) — ✅ Done

  - [x] Create `packages/special/` directory
  - [x] Move `gateway/` → `special/gateway/`
  - [x] Move `khulnasoft/` → `special/khulnasoft/`
  - [x] Update imports

- [x] **Organize MCP** (1 day) — ✅ Done (consolidated as single `packages/mcp/` package)

  - [x] Move MCP packages
  - [x] Update references

- [x] **Organize validation & infra** (1 day) — ✅ Done

  - [x] Create `packages/validation/`
  - [x] Create `packages/infrastructure/`
  - [x] Move packages

- [x] **Final validation** (1 day) — ✅ Done
  - [x] Full type check
  - [x] Full test run
  - [x] Manual verification

### Wave 5: Examples Reorganization (Week 18)

**Target**: Categorize and organize 20+ examples

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (21 examples reorganized into 4 category directories)

```
Before:
examples/
├── ai-functions/
├── angular/
├── next-app/
├── express/
├── mcp/
├── ... (21 examples flat, hard to discover)

After:

## Phase 4: Release & Communication (Weeks 19-20)

**Status**: ⏳ IN PROGRESS (migration guide + docs done; version bump ready, publish pending)

> **Note (Aug 2026):** The repo is currently at v2.0.0. The enterprise architecture
> restructure is a **patch-level release with no public API changes** (package names
> and exports are unchanged), so there is no breaking "v3→v4" migration for users.
> The "v4.0" framing in this plan is aspirational; the actual release is a patch bump
> driven by `.changeset/migration-phase-1.md` and `.changeset/examples-reorganize.md`.

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk: Breaking Changes

**Risk**: Users have code that breaks with new structure

**Mitigation**:

- Extensive testing before release
- Create codemods for automatic migration
- Provide clear upgrade guide
- Support period with hotfixes
- Early beta period for feedback

### Medium Risk: Migration Errors

**Risk**: We miss import updates, causing runtime errors

**Mitigation**:

- Create automated validator
- Run comprehensive test suite
- Manual spot-checks by team
- Code review of every move

### Medium Risk: Performance Regression

**Risk**: Build times increase with new structure

**Mitigation**:

- Monitor build times during migration
- Optimize Turbo pipeline as needed
- Cache build artifacts
- Benchmark before/after

### Low Risk: Developer Confusion

**Risk**: Developers get confused with new structure

**Mitigation**:

- Extensive documentation
- Clear CODEOWNERS
- Generation tools to scaffold new packages
- Contributor onboarding guide

---

- **GitHub Projects**: Detailed task tracking
- **Office hours**: Support & troubleshooting

---

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise, we have a rollback path:

### Partial Rollback (< 20% impact)

- Revert affected package migrations
- Keep successful migrations
- Release patch with limited structure change

### Full Rollback (critical)

- Revert all changes
- Stay on v3.x
- Plan for v5.0 different approach

### Decision Criteria

- More than 5 critical bugs
- Performance regression > 50%
- Loss of test coverage
- Major API incompatibility

---

## Detailed Task Breakdown

### For Jira/GitHub Projects

Each package migration follows this template:

```
[MIGRATION] Move {package} to {new location}

Description:
- Move packages/{old}/ → packages/{new}/
- Update all imports
- Update docs
- Verify tests pass

Definition of Done:
- [ ] Package moved
- [ ] All imports updated (grep verified)
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Types checking
- [ ] No console errors in examples
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Merged to main
```

---

## Documentation Updates Schedule

- **Week 7**: Start updating docs as migrations happen
- **Week 15**: All docs updated for new structure
- **Week 19**: Final review & polish

---

## Version Management During Migration

### Versioning Strategy

- **v3.x**: Maintain current structure (bug fixes only)
- **v4.0-alpha.1**: First reorganized release
- **v4.0-rc.1**: Release candidate (full testing)
- **v4.0**: Final release
- **v3.x → v4.0**: Long migration period with clear guide

---

## Post-Migration Work

After release, continue with:

- Monitor for issues in production
- Gather feedback from community
- Plan next improvements
- Establish new governance practices
- Scale testing & CI/CD
