```
Before:
packages/
├── ai/
├── react/
├── rsc/
└── ... (50 packages mixed)

After:
packages/
├── core/
│   ├── ai/
│   ├── shared/
│   └── telemetry/
```

**Tasks:**

- [ ] **Organize core packages** (3 days)
  - [ ] Create `packages/core/` directory
  - [ ] Move `packages/ai/` → `packages/core/ai/`
  - [ ] Create `packages/core/shared/` from utilities
  - [ ] Create `packages/core/telemetry/` from telemetry code
  - [ ] Update all imports
  - [ ] Run tests

- [ ] **Update references** (2 days)
  - [ ] Update package.json files
  - [ ] Update import paths across repo
  - [ ] Update docs links
  - [ ] Update examples

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Risk: Breaking Changes

**Risk**: Users have code that breaks with new structure

**Mitigation**:
- Extensive testing before release
- Create codemods for automatic migration
- Provide clear upgrade guide
- Support period with hotfixes
- Early beta period for feedback

### Medium Risk: Migration Errors

**Risk**: We miss import updates, causing runtime errors

**Mitigation**:
- Create automated validator
- Run comprehensive test suite
- Manual spot-checks by team
- Code review of every move

### Medium Risk: Performance Regression

**Risk**: Build times increase with new structure

**Mitigation**:
- Monitor build times during migration
- Optimize Turbo pipeline as needed
- Cache build artifacts
- Benchmark before/after

### Low Risk: Developer Confusion

**Risk**: Developers get confused with new structure

**Mitigation**:
- Extensive documentation
- Clear CODEOWNERS
- Generation tools to scaffold new packages
- Contributor onboarding guide

```

### Communication Channels

- **Weekly sync**: Progress review
- **Slack channel**: `#ai-toolkit-migration`
- **GitHub Projects**: Detailed task tracking
- **Office hours**: Support & troubleshooting

---

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise, we have a rollback path:

### Partial Rollback (< 20% impact)
- Revert affected package migrations
- Keep successful migrations
- Release patch with limited structure change

### Full Rollback (critical)
- Revert all changes
- Stay on v3.x
- Plan for v5.0 different approach

### Decision Criteria
- More than 5 critical bugs
- Performance regression > 50%
- Loss of test coverage
- Major API incompatibility

---

## Detailed Task Breakdown

### For Jira/GitHub Projects

Each package migration follows this template:

```
[MIGRATION] Move {package} to {new location}

Description:
- Move packages/{old}/ → packages/{new}/
- Update all imports
- Update docs
- Verify tests pass

Definition of Done:
- [ ] Package moved
- [ ] All imports updated (grep verified)
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Types checking
- [ ] No console errors in examples
- [ ] Code reviewed
- [ ] Merged to main
```

---

## Documentation Updates Schedule

- **Week 7**: Start updating docs as migrations happen
- **Week 15**: All docs updated for new structure
- **Week 19**: Final review & polish

---

## Version Management During Migration

### Versioning Strategy

- **v3.x**: Maintain current structure (bug fixes only)
- **v4.0-alpha.1**: First reorganized release
- **v4.0-rc.1**: Release candidate (full testing)
- **v4.0**: Final release
- **v3.x → v4.0**: Long migration period with clear guide

---

## Post-Migration Work

After release, continue with:

- Monitor for issues in production
- Gather feedback from community
- Plan next improvements
- Establish new governance practices
- Scale testing & CI/CD

---

**Status**: Planning Phase (Weeks 1-2)  
**Next Review**: End of Week 2  
**Approval Required**: All stakeholders sign off
